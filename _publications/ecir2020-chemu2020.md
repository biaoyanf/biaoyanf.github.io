## Abstract 
We introduce a new evaluation lab named ChEMU (Cheminformatics Elsevier Melbourne University), part of the 11th Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF-2020). ChEMU involves two key information extraction tasks over chemical reactions from patents. Task 1---Named entity recognition---involves identifying chemical compounds as well as their types in context, i.e., to assign the label of a chemical compound according to the role which the compound plays within a chemical reaction. Task 2---Event extraction over chemical reactions---involves event trigger detection and argument recognition. We briefly present the motivations and goals of the ChEMU tasks, as well as resources and evaluation methodology.
