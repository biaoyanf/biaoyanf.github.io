## Abstract 
In this paper, we show the effectiveness of before– and after–sentences as additional context for sentence classification in evidence-based medicine. Although pre-trained language models encode contextualized representation, we found that the additional contexts improve sentence classification in terms of ROC (micro) score in the ALTA 2022 shared task. Additionally, averaging the probability of top model predictions boosts the performance, and our results for both public and private test sets officially claim the first rank of the ALTA 2022 shared task.
