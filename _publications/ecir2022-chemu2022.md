## Abstract 
The discovery of new chemical compounds is a key driver of the chemistry and pharmaceutical industries, and many other industrial sectors. Patents serve as a critical source of information about new chemical compounds. The ChEMU (Cheminformatics Elsevier Melbourne Universities) lab addresses information extraction over chemical patents and aims to advance the state of the art on this topic. ChEMU lab 2022, as part of the 13th Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF-2022), will be the third ChEMU lab. The ChEMU 2020 lab provided two information extraction tasks, named entity recognition and event extraction. The ChEMU 2021 lab introduced two more tasks, chemical reaction reference resolution and anaphora resolution. For ChEMU 2022, we plan to re-run all the four tasks with a new task on semantic classification for tables as the fifth one. In this paper, we introduce ChEMU 2022, including its motivation, goals, tasks, resources, and evaluation framework.
